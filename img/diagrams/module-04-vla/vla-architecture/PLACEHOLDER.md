# Vision-Language-Action Architecture Diagrams

Placeholder for VLA model architecture and integration diagrams.

## Suggested Diagrams

1. **vla-model-architecture.svg** - VLA transformer architecture
2. **rt-2-architecture.svg** - Robotics Transformer 2 model
3. **palm-e-integration.svg** - PaLM-E embodied multimodal model
4. **multimodal-fusion.svg** - Vision + Language + Proprioception fusion
5. **end-to-end-policy.svg** - From perception to action execution
6. **vla-training-pipeline.svg** - Data collection and training workflow

These diagrams should illustrate how vision, language, and action modalities are integrated.
