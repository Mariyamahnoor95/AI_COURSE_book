## Prompt

```
/sp.specify Specify the Docusaurus UI for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Interactive Textbook.

Objective:
Design a clean, academic UI that supports structured, week-based learning for a 13-week robotics curriculum.

UI Scope (ONLY):
- Docusaurus theme configuration
- Layout, navigation, and visual hierarchy
- Homepage, navbar, sidebar, and doc pages
- Styling via CSS / theme overrides

UI Requirements:

1. Homepage
- Title: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"
- Subtitle: "An Interactive 13-Week Curriculum"
- Clear call-to-action: "Start Learning" → Foundations Week 1
- Sectioned overview:
  - Foundations (Weeks 1–2)
  - ROS 2 (Weeks 3–5)
  - Digital Twin (Weeks 6–7)
  - NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 8–10)
  - Vision-Language-Action (Weeks 11–13)

2. Sidebar Navigation
- Fixed left sidebar
- Hierarchy:
  Module
    └── Week
         └── Chapter
         └── 📝 Assessment (last item per module)
- Sidebar labels must match doc IDs exactly
- Collapsible modules, expanded by default
- No autogenerated sidebars

3. Doc Page Layout
- Wide content column (optimized for long reading)
- Max content width ≥ 900px
- Sticky table of contents on the right
- Prominent previous/next navigation at bottom

4. Visual Semantics
- Distinct styling for:
  - Concepts (info callouts)
  - Code examples (syntax highlighted blocks)
  - Warnings / pitfalls
  - Assessments (badge or icon)
- Use Docusaurus admonitions only

5. Typography & Theme
- Sans-serif body font, monospace for code
- High contrast, accessible color palette
- Light + dark mode enabled
- No custom fonts requiring external CDNs

Constraints:
- No React components beyond Docusaurus theming
- No runtime JS logic
- No changes to backend or content ingestion
- UI must function even with placeholder docs

Acceptance Criteria:
- Site builds successfully with empty or stub docs
- All navigation works without sidebar ID errors
- Users reach any chapter within ≤2 clicks
- UI remains stable when content is added incrementally

Out of Scope:
- Chatbot UI
- Custom diagrams or animations
- Backend-driven UI behavior
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Docusaurus UI following Spec-Driven Development methodology.

**Branch Created**: `002-docusaurus-ui`

**Specification Highlights**:
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) covering: curriculum discovery, navigation, content reading, theme switching, and responsive design
- 34 functional requirements organized into 7 categories: Homepage, Sidebar Navigation, Doc Page Layout, Visual Semantics, Typography & Theme, Build & Configuration, Navigation Efficiency
- 10 measurable success criteria (technology-agnostic)
- 7 edge cases identified and addressed
- 6 key entities defined (Module, Week, Chapter, Assessment, Navigation Link, Theme Configuration)
- 12 assumptions documented
- 8 dependencies identified
- 10 constraints defined
- 14 out-of-scope items explicitly excluded

**Quality Validation**: All checklist items passed
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements well-defined with reasonable assumptions
- All requirements testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- Specification ready for planning phase

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Desktop-first approach acceptable for technical curriculum
- WCAG AA compliance sufficient (not AAA)
- Build tolerance for incomplete content (onBrokenLinks: 'warn')
- No external font CDNs - system fonts only
- Homepage custom component acceptable within Docusaurus theming constraints

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete UI specification created for 13-week robotics curriculum textbook, defining all navigation, layout, and theme requirements
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validated against quality checklist - all items passed (0 clarifications needed, 34 testable requirements, 10 measurable success criteria)
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (250 lines, 34 functional requirements) and requirements.md checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` to create architectural design, or `/sp.clarify` if user wants to refine requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully captures user intent without implementation details. Strong focus on measurable outcomes and technology-agnostic language. Comprehensive edge cases and constraints documented.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification created without requiring user clarifications
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Requirements checklist validation - PASSED (all 12 criteria met)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with detailed user requirements
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - specification complete and validated
